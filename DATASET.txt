Abstract:
The "IoT – Aquaculture and Monitoring" project focuses on creating a prototype of a smart aquaculture monitoring system that enables real-time water quality monitoring using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. This system is critical for fish farming and other aquaculture environments, where maintaining optimal water quality is vital for the health and productivity of aquatic organisms. Using Arduino and potentiometers to simulate key sensors, this prototype successfully models the behavior of a real-time monitoring system. The monitored parameters include pH level, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonia concentration, and water level. These data points are continuously evaluated, and alerts are generated based on predefined thresholds to signify when corrective actions are required. This phase documents the demonstration, feedback refinement, final testing, and preparation for project handover.

IoT-Aquaculture and Water Quality Monitoring System (Simulated Sensors using Arduino)
1. Project Objective
The objective of this system is to monitor critical water quality parameters in an aquaculture environment using simulated sensors via Arduino. The setup uses potentiometers to simulate analog data for different water quality indicators and mimics real-world sensor behaviors. This document outlines the structure of data collection, conversion methods, interpretation rules, and a sample dataset schema for logging and analysis.

2. System Setup Overview
Sensor/Parameter	Simulated Input	Arduino Pin	Description
pH Sensor	Potentiometer	A0	Simulates pH levels via voltage readings
Turbidity Sensor	Potentiometer	A1	Simulates water clarity using analog values
Dissolved Oxygen	Potentiometer	A2	Simulates DO levels in % using mapped analog input
Ammonia Sensor (NH₃)	Potentiometer	A5	Simulates ammonia concentration as a percentage
Water Level Sensor	Potentiometer	A4	Simulates ultrasonic sensor measuring water depth

Each sensor outputs a value between 0 and 1023 (from analogRead()), which is converted into meaningful units using map() or formula-based scaling.

⚠️ Note: Actual values depend on the position of the potentiometers during simulation.

6. Data Logging (How to Capture this Data)
Use Arduino IDE’s Serial Monitor or Serial Plotter for real-time output.

For persistent logging:

Use a serial logger like Tera Term, PuTTY, or CoolTerm

OR upload to platforms like ThingSpeak, Blynk, or Google Sheets using WiFi module (e.g., ESP8266/ESP32).

Data can be stored in CSV format and visualized using Excel, Google Sheets, or Python-based dashboards.
